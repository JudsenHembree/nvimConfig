# The god gamer himself
*Three Plugins for the C-kings under the sky,*

*Seven for the lint-lords in their halls of stone,*

*Nine for Mortal Undergrads doomed to die,*

*One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne*

*In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.*

*One config to rule them all, One config to find them,*

*One config to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them,*

*In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.*
